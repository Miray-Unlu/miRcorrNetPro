# mirCorrNetPro

miRcorrNetPro tool utilizes Cross-Validation to reveal hidden biological knowledge in multi-omic data analysis. This tool performs integrative analysis of omics datasets  via machine learning (ML) approach to identify significant biomarkers. Here, the findings and results are presented based on microRNA and gene expression profiles. The miRNA groups and their associated target genes are identified in this study. The tool is also applicable for other omics datatypes. 

The tool tracks group scoring, ranking and other information through the cross-validation iterations.
Heatmap visualizations enable deep novel insights into the collective behavior of clusters of groups in cellular signaling and hence facilitate detection of potential biomarkers for the disease under investigation.
